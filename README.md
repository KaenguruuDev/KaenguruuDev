# Kaenguruu Dev
---

### About
HeyðŸ‘‹, I'm a german programmer, developing in C#, Python, and some other languages.

For game dev I'm using the **open source** game engine [Godot](https://godotengine.org/).

### Projects
Currently my active project (since it's taking up a lot of time) is a discord bot that I'm hoping to release to the public at some point - until then, it'll need some more work though.

**You can see all my projects on [KaenguruuDev/Projects](https://kaenguruu-dev.me/projects).**
